# When running CodeQL on pull requests, cancel in-progress jobs if another run is started for the
# same pull request. This reduces our costs when you push multiple times in quick succession.
concurrency:
  # This concurrency group cancels in-progress jobs or runs on pull_request events only.
  # github.head_ref is only defined on pull_request events. If github.head_ref is undefined, the
  # concurrency group will fallback to the run ID, which is guaranteed to be both unique and
  # defined for the run.
